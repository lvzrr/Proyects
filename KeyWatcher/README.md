# KeyWatcher 

A daemon to display keystrokes through the keyboard using raylib (Only works on **POSIX** operating systems, or at least in Linux)

> [!Warning]
I'm currently working on it, it can't display certain symbols yet (basically because of raylib's shitty UTF-8 render implementation)

## To run it
First change the paths in run.sh, then: 
```bash 
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```
